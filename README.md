# Preferred Bash Environmnt
This repository aims to provide a portable and distro-agnostic bash environment that I can quickly pull and install on any Linux machine. Its scripts, functions, aliases and packages are ones that I find useful and enjoy having on any machine which I regularly use.

While the repository is *intended* to be portable, it should not be assumed to be in all cases. Distros I use with regularity include Centos 8, Debian 10, Manjaro, and Ubuntu 20.04 and are, for the most part, supported by this repository.

## Using this repository
To use this repo, clone it to your home directory and run `~/env/install.sh`. Be aware that it will replace your existing `.profile`, `.bashrc`, `.screenrc`, `.vimrc`, and `.vim` directory, as well as variables such as `$SCRIPTS` and `$FUNCTIONS`, if they exist already. Once installed, run `source ~/.profile` to load the new envoronment. It *may* also turn your shell pink.

If you also wish to install packages that I find useful, run `. ~/.env/packages.sh` after installing the environment. Note that the script does not (currently) work very well, and is (obviously) not portable to OSX.

Lastly, it bears noting that certain functions, scripts, and/or aliases are useful only to me (as they pertain to systems on my home network); remove them and fork the repository if you feel the urge. Scripts in `env/gsh` are encrypted, and therefore only usable *by* me.

## Directory Structure
This repository and its installation scripts add three directories to ${PATH}:
* scripts
* functions
* gsh

The scripts and functions directories are largely self-explanitory; the gsh directory contains PGP-encrypted scripts which are decrypted and interpreted by a bash subshell. These scripts will not be usable without the public key used to encrypt them, but you can create your own gsh scripts with the 'gshmake' script located in env/scripts.

## File Structure
As previously noted, running install.sh will replace the user's	~/.{profile,bashrc,vimrc,screenrc} scripts. ~/.env/bashrc also loads ~/env/aliases, ~/.env/vars.sh, and ~/.env/functions/\*, which set user aliases, environment variables, and functions respectively.

## To Do:
* Make packages.sh interpretable by `apt`, `yum`, and `pacman` package managers.
* Update env/packages/{apt,pacman,pip3,snap,yum}.txt package lists.
